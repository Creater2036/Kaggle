# Kaggle Survey (Competition): Task to interpret results of a 2020 Kaggle Survey by producing a story that describes unique results found in the data. Competition was based on Composition, Originality, and Documentation. For data visualization I used Matplotlib and Seaborn.

# Suicide Rates: Using data visualization with plotly and pandas to discover patterns about suicide rates throughout countries.

# Asteroid Results: Cleaning the data, along with using sklearn and tensorflow to find the best predictive model that can predict whether an asteroid will hit earth or not

# ML-Severity: Challenge to predict how severe a car accident is. Required lots of data cleaning using encoding, filling in missing values, and new columns. Used Neural Networks and Random Forest for the multi-classification task.

# World_Health_Statistics: Explored data from the CDC and focused on subjects like basic sanitization, alcohol use, women's violence, and more. Used data visualization tools such as plotly and seaborn to generate meaninful graphs of the data and check the validity against online articles or general assumptions people have.
