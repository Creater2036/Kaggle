# Kaggle

# Suicide Rates: Using data visualization with plotly and pandas to discover patterns about suicide rates throughout countries.

# Asteroid Results: Cleaning the data, along with using sklearn and tensorflow to find the best predictive model that can predict whether an asteroid will hit earth or not

# ML-Severity: Challenge to predict how severe a car accident is. Required lots of data cleaning using encoding, filling in missing values, and new columns. Used Neural Networks and Random Forest for the multi-classification task.

# Kaggle Survey (Competition): Task to interpret results of a 2020 Kaggle Survey by producing a story that describes unique results found in the data. Competition was based on Composition, Originality, and Documentation. For data visualization I used Matplotlib and Seaborn.
