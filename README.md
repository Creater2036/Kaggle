# Kaggle Survey (Competition): Task to interpret results of a 2020 Kaggle Survey by producing a story that describes unique results found in the data. Competition was based on Composition, Originality, and Documentation. For data visualization I used Matplotlib and Seaborn.

# Suicide Rates: Using data visualization with plotly and pandas to discover patterns about suicide rates throughout countries.

# Asteroid Results: Cleaning the data, along with using sklearn and tensorflow to find the best predictive model that can predict whether an asteroid will hit earth or not

# ML-Severity: Challenge to predict how severe a car accident is. Required lots of data cleaning using encoding, filling in missing values, and new columns. Used Neural Networks and Random Forest for the multi-classification task.

# World Health Statistics: Explored data from the CDC and focused on subjects like basic sanitization, alcohol use, women's violence, and more. Used data visualization tools such as plotly and seaborn to generate meaninful graphs of the data and check the validity against online articles or general assumptions people have.

# Telecom Analysis and Predictions: Task to predict whether a client will renew their contract with the company. Using libraries like seaborn and matplotlib, I was able to analyze the data in unique ways that revealed new conclusions about the data. I also used multiple models including Regression, SVM's, Ensemble methods, and Neural Networks to find the model that best predicts whether a client will renew the contract or not.

# Android Permissions: Using data for Android apps to figure out whether or not an app is a scam. Mainly focused on Data Engineering and NLP to extract best features from model with over 100 features. Reached accuracy of 82% with Gradient Boosting.
