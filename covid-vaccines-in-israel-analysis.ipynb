One interesting thing to note though is that there seems to be less cases among those fully vaccinared compared to those who have some vaccination.\n\nThe reason for this actually lies in the definition of vaccinated people. A vaccinated person counts as someone who recieved one or more doses but then got Covid. This means that someone who recieved just one dose but then got Covid is considered fully vaccinated and will be counted in the fully vaccinated people that got Covid section. I'm not sure about this, but it could also apply to people who got Covid and then got the vaccine afterwards, they may have also been put in the new cases for fully vaccinated people section.\n\nAnother reason could also be because lots of people (43%) are considered fully vaccinated and most of the rest are not vaccinated at all. There are only about 18% of people that didn't get the third dose and even then we have to remember that if they got the first 2 doses and it has been less than a half a year, they previously had Covid, or they got Covid after the vaccine, then they are still considered \"fully vaccinated\".
